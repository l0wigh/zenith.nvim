# ZenithOS theme for Neovim

![ZenithOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/L0Wigh/zenith.nvim/master/zenith.nvim.jpg)

ZenithOS was (RIP, long live [ZealOS](https://github.com/Zeal-Operating-System/ZealOS)) a fork of TempleOS
The default theme for ZenithOS was so great that I decided to port it to Neovim.

# Installation

Use your favorite package manager to install that theme.
It requires Lush.nvim to be working, so make sure to install it too.


For packer.nvim just install it like that :

```lua
use { 'L0Wigh/vanessa.nvim', requires = {'rktjmp/lush.nvim'} }
```

# What is missing

- gitsigns
